Hi!

My name is Kavan and I’m currently working towards my bachelor's in computer science. I’m currently enrolled at CCRI in a general studies major. I chose to go to community college because it makes a lot more sense financially. I'm planning on transferring to the university of Rhode Island when I finish my associates degree. 

I like to think of myself as a well-read person, so I try to keep up with international politics. I’m also into learning languages. I’m learning French, Japanese and Mandarin at the movement. I keep myself updated with the latest tech news and changes in the tech industries even though I still wouldn't consider myself a part of it. :( 

Either way, I hope you stick around. I hope to make weekly updates to this page. ;) 

btw, if it wasn't obvious this website is github pages [github pages][github-page] made with Jekyll [jekyll website][jekyll-web] a static website builder.
