&lt;p&gt;My name is Kavan and I’m currently working towards my bachelor’s in computer science. I’m currently enrolled at CCRI in a general studies major. I chose to go to community college because it makes a lot more sense financially. I’m planning on transferring to the university of Rhode Island when I finish my associates degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of myself as a well-read person, so I try to keep up with international politics. I’m also into learning languages. I’m learning French, Japanese and Mandarin at the movement. I keep myself updated with the latest tech news and changes in the tech industries even though I still wouldn’t consider myself a part of it. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I hope you stick around. I’ll be making updates to this site as much as I can. (O w O)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw, if it wasn’t obvious this website is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt; made with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt; a static website builder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Hi!</summary></entry></feed>
